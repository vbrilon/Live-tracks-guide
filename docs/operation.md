# Operation (Bringing It All Together)

Power‑up and line check
- Power order: XR18 → connect USB → launch Ableton/Ableset → load set.
- Verify live mics/instruments (1–12).

Tracks check
- Play a song; confirm:
  - Click (ch 13) only in IEMs (Main LR OFF)
  - Cues (ch 14) only in IEMs (Main LR OFF)
  - Stems (15–18) audible in FOH and IEMs
- Gain stage around 0 dB on meters; avoid red.

Virtual soundcheck
- With the band muted, play stems to set FOH and IEM balances safely.

Show operation
- Use Ableset or your footswitch to start/stop/advance scenes.
- If Ableset fails, trigger Scenes directly in Ableton as a fallback.

Practical safety tips
- Tape labels for 13–18 on the XR18; mark Click/Cues “IEM only”.
- Keep Wi‑Fi off unless needed; prefer wired network for OSC.
- Bring a backup USB cable and a small power conditioner for the Mac.

Quick reference
- Sample rate 48 kHz; Buffer 128–256
- Ableton outputs: Click 13, Cues 14, Stems 15–18 → XR18 ch 13–18 (USB)
- Ultranet P16: 1–10 live channels; 11 Click; 12 Cues; 13–16 stems
- Instrument‑swappable (any instrument): keep the same channel number (e.g., Bass → 6, Guitar → 7, Keys → 12) and flip XR18 Source (Analog ↔ USB). Remove that instrument from stems to avoid doubles.
- Drums preferred map: Kick 1, Snare 2, Tom 3, OH L 4, OH R 5; stereo fallback 4/5
- IEM buses: 1–5 mono, Pre‑EQ; Aux Out 1–5 → IEM chain
- Safety: “Main LR” OFF on Click/Cues
