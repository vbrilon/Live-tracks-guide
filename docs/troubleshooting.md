# Troubleshooting

Common issues
- XR18 not visible in Ableton: try a different USB port/cable; power‑cycle XR18; restart Ableton.
- No audio on ch 13–18: check Ableton `Audio To` and XR18 Source = USB.
- Click/Cues in mains: ensure “Main LR” is OFF on ch 13–14.
- Pops/clicks: raise buffer to 256; close background apps.
- Out‑of‑sync clips: Warp Off on all stems; re‑export aligned stems from Logic.
- Ableset not controlling: device enabled in Ableset; Live in focus; verify mappings.
- Missing bass/guitar when using backing: route Ableton to the live channel number (e.g., 6/7) and flip XR18 Source to USB.
- Drum duplication: remove drums from `15–18` stems if also routing to `1–5`, or mute `1–5` when drum stems live in `15–18`.
- Wrong channel after swapping live ↔ tracks: keep the same channel number for any instrument (e.g., Keys → 12). Route Ableton to that number and flip XR18 Source (Analog ↔ USB). Don’t move Ultranet slots when swapping.

If problems persist
- Bypass Ableset and trigger Scenes directly in Ableton.
- Reboot XR18 (power off/on) and relaunch Ableton with the XR18 connected.
- Confirm XR18 firmware and X Air Edit versions are current.
